# Frontend Mentor - FAQ accordion card solution

This is a solution to the [FAQ accordion card challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/faq-accordion-card-XlyjD0Oam). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 

I decided to build this project with Bootstrap 5.0 (the first project in which I have used Bootstrap 5.0) which I thought might be quicker, but actually it was a bit of a learning curve to get the project to work the way I wanted to. Thankfully the Bootstrap documentation is very thorough and I was able to solve the problems I encountered.

Along with the Bootstrap framework I also wrote my own custom CSS and JS. Custom CSS was necessary to align the SVG images that came with the project. Hint: `background-position` really helped me out here! 

The project requirements are for a responsive design viewable in 375px (mobile) and 1440px (desktop) wide screens. My project is viewable in 375px, 768px, 1200px and 1440px wide screens. 

Overall this was a fun project and I learned some new tricks with Bootstrap 5.0, as well as increased my understanding of how to manipulate SVG's.
