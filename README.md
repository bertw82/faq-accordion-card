# Frontend Mentor - FAQ accordion card solution

This is a solution to the [FAQ accordion card challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/faq-accordion-card-XlyjD0Oam). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 

I decided to build this project with Bootstrap 5.0 (the first project in which I have used Bootstrap 5.0) which I thought might be quicker, but actually it was a bit of a learning curve to get the project to work the way I wanted to. Thankfully the Bootstrap documentation is very thorough and I was able to solve the problems I encountered at first.

Along with the Bootstrap framework Ialso wrote my own custom CSS and JS. Custom CSS was necessary to align the SVG images that came with the project. Hint: `background-position` really helped me out here! 

Overall this was a fun project and I learned some new tricks with Bootstrap 5.0, as well as increased my understanding of how to manipulate SVG's.
